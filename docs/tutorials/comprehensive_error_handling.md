# Comprehensive Error Handling in RabbitMirror

RabbitMirror includes a robust error handling system designed to ensure reliability and graceful degradation in the face of various errors. This document outlines the key components and strategies used for error handling within the project.

## Key Components

### Retry System
- **Purpose**: Automatically retries operations that fail due to transient errors.
- **Configuration**: Utilizes `RetryConfig` to define parameters like max attempts, base delay, and applicable exceptions.

**Example**:
```python
@with_retry(config=RetryConfig(max_attempts=3, base_delay=2.0, jitter=True))
def fetch_data():
    # Your data fetching logic here
```

### Circuit Breaker
- **Purpose**: Prevents system overload by breaking a circuit after repeated failures, allowing time for recovery.
- **Implementation**: `CircuitBreaker` class tracks failure rates and transitions between states (CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN).

**Example**:
```python
@with_circuit_breaker(service_name="api_service")
def call_external_api():
    # Your API calling logic here
```

### Error Recovery Manager
- **Purpose**: Manages custom recovery strategies for different types of errors.
- **Usage**: Register recovery strategies using `ErrorRecoveryManager.register_recovery_strategy()`.

**Example**:
```python
recovery_manager = ErrorRecoveryManager()
recovery_manager.register_recovery_strategy(NetworkError, custom_network_recovery_strategy)
```

## Advanced Strategies

### Fallback Mechanisms
- **Purpose**: Provide alternative actions when primary operations fail.
- **Implementation**: Use `@with_fallback` decorator to specify a fallback function.

**Example**:
```python
@with_fallback(lambda: "default value")
def risky_operation():
    raise ValueError("Something went wrong!")
```

### Timeout Handlers
- **Purpose**: Limit the execution time of operations to avoid hanging.
- **Implementation**: Use `@with_timeout` decorator to enforce execution time limits.

**Example**:
```python
@with_timeout(timeout_seconds=5.0)
def time_sensitive_function():
    # Operation that should complete quickly
```

## Monitoring & Health

### Error Health Monitor
- **Purpose**: Tracks error occurrences, calculates error rates, and evaluates system health.
- **Capabilities**: Provides methods to get current error rate, most common errors, and a health report.

**Example**:
```python
monitor = ErrorHealthMonitor()
monitor.record_error(ValueError("Sample error"), context={})
error_rate = monitor.get_error_rate(time_window_minutes=5)
```

### Comprehensive Logging
- **Purpose**: Offers detailed logging for all error handling mechanisms to aid debugging and auditing.
- **Approach**: Each decorator and recovery method logs its actions and decisions.

## Customization

All error handling components are designed to be highly configurable, allowing RabbitMirror developers to tailor the behavior to match specific needs. Refer to the detailed API documentation for each component to explore additional configuration options.
